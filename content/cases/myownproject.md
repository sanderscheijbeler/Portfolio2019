This project started while i was applying for jobs. I was seeing great projects, talking to developers and learning about nice features. 

Comparing with my first site i wanted to be more organised with my CSS. So I started using smaller scss files. And think about the way I wanted to use the navigation bar. Which led me to getting to know css animations alot better. I was really proud of the look and feel of the menu and the hamburger.

During the build of this project i was still learning alot about basic JavaScript. I was getting results with jQuery but a good friend of mine told me its better to get the basics with JS down first. So i tried too remove all the jQuery and convert that to JS (and if possible, ES6).
Eventually i started working on a small script for the contactform. It wasnt ment to really send data but i wanted to learn JS with something practical and not `foo`, `bar`, `baz` stuff.
