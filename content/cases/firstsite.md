A 'first' website is usualy not a showstopper. True. But I wanted to display where i came from since i started applying for a job.

On this project i used Gulp to compile the bootstrap 3, Sass, and JavaScript.
On the CV page, on mobile and tablet, i wanted to use a simple click event to slide out the personal information bit. But after many tries I learned that whatever you try and no matter how long you stare at CSS. You just cant animate `display: none` to anything else.

Look at this project in [Github](https://github.com/sanderscheijbeler/portfolio-website).
