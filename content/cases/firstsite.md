A 'first' website is usually not a showstopper. True. But I wanted to display where I came from since I started applying for a job.

On this project I used Gulp to compile the Bootstrap 3, Sass, and JavaScript. On the CV page I wanted to use  a simple click event to slide out the personal information, I applied this also for use on a mobile and tablet. But after many tries I learned that whatever you try and no matter how long you stare at CSS. You just can't animate `display: none` to anything else.

Look at this project in [Github](https://github.com/sanderscheijbeler/portfolio-website).
