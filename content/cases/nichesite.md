As a learning project i wanted to see if i was able to create a fast, modular wordpress theme. I chose for to create this theme with the Timber plugin, enableing the use of twig templating. Because of this i am able to make reusable components within the website and connect them to different endpoints. This website is a result of my wife and i researching more ways to live an easier/more comfortable financial life.
This project is still ongoing.
