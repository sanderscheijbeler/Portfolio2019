As a learning project I wanted to see if I was able to create a fast, modular Wordpress theme. I chose to create this theme with the Timber plugin, enabling the use of twig templating. Because of this I am able to make reusable components within the website and connect them to different endpoints. This website is a result of my wife and I, researching more ways to live an easier/more comfortable financial life. This project is still ongoing.
